## Random iOS write-ups
_If Burbulla saw what I tried to pass off as linear algebra in these two posts, he'd probably try and take my iron ring away_
* [How do basic 3D transforms of iOS views work under the hood?](https://thealexanderlee.com/blog/how-do-3d-transforms-of-ios-views-work-under-the-hood)
* [3D transforms on iOS under the hood part II: perspective shifts](https://thealexanderlee.com/blog/3d-transforms-on-ios-under-the-hood-part-2-perspective-shifts)

## Open-source Swift Package I wrote
* [DesignReviewer](https://github.com/alexslee/DesignReviewer): cut down on Xcode lag, and debug/make tweaks to your UI right from your application
    *  Complete with an implementation of the 3D view hierarchy experience you get from Xcode, written with incremental `CALayer` transforms + `CAAnimation` -- handily enough, those transformations are [documented in the code](https://github.com/alexslee/DesignReviewer/blob/0d36b57f57d3581bc44defb43ec01d70dc0ca2cb/Sources/DesignReviewer/Exploded%20Hierarchy/DesignReviewExplodedHierarchyContainerView.swift#L74) + the fundamentals are written in the articles above

## Random stat generator that is definitely undercounting but at least it looks nice
